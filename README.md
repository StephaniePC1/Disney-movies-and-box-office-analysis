Analysis of Disney movie dataset in Python

## Motivation
Since the 1930s, Walt Disney Studios has released more than 600 films covering a wide range of genres. While some movies are indeed directed towards kids, many are intended for a broad audience.This project, analyzes data to see how Disney movies have changed in popularity since its first movie release. I have also performed hypothesis testing to see what aspects of a movie contribute to its success.
